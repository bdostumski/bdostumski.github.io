#### In this course, I learned about the twelve-factor app methodology, microservices, and Istio foundational technologies to connect, manage, and secure those microservices. I learned how to put all of those technologies together in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. These cloud-native technologies are the essentials for building new apps for the cloud. Microservices are the building blocks for cloud architecture.
