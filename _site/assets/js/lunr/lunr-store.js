        "excerpt":"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents.   Mozilla MDN Documentation   HTTP Methods      GET retrieves data.   POST creates resources.   PUT updates or creates a resource.   PATCH applies partial updates.   DELETE removes resources.   HEAD fetches headers - same as GET but does not return the body, only headers.   OPTIONS checks available methods - describe the communication options for the target resource.   CONNECT establishes a tunnel - establish a tunnel to the server, usually for SSL/TLS.   TRACE perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.   HTTP Status Codes      1xx: Informational Resource - indicate that the request was received, and the process is continuing.            100 Continue: The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.           2xx: Successful Responses - the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.            200 OK: The request was successful.       201 CREATED: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.       204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response.           3xx: Redirection Messages - further action needs to be taken to complete the request.            301 Moved Permanently: The resource has been moved to a new URL permanently.       302 Found: The resource has been found at a different URL, temporarily.       304 Not Modified: The resource has not been modified since the last request.           4xx: Client Error Responses - the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.            400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.       401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required, and it has failed or has not been provided.       403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.       404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.       429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (“rate limiting”).           5xx: Server Error Responses - the server failed to fulfill a valid request.            500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.       502 Bad Gateway: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.       503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload.       504 Gateway Timeout: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.           HTTP Headers   Common HTTP Headers      Accept - Informs the server about the media types the client can process            [ Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml ]           Accept-Encoding - Indicates the encoding algorithms (like gzip) the client supports (it reduces the size of the payload to 70% and can speed up the application by around 15% - it is very important when we have a large amount of data)            [ Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br ]           Accept-Language - Specifies the preferred languages for the response            [ Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 ]           Content-Type - Specifies the media type of the resource, crucial for both requests and responses            [ Content-Type: application/json ]           Location - Used in redirects to indicate the new URL            [ Location: https://example.com/new-pag ]           Caching HTTP Headers      Cache-Control - Specifies caching policies, helping to improve load times and reduce server load            [ Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate ]           ETag - Allows the server to identify the version of a resource to enable conditional requests and reduce bandwidth            [ ETag: “12345” ]           Expires - Specifies an expiration date for cached resources            [ Expires: Wed, 21 Oct 2025 07:28:00 GMT ]           Authentication HTTP Headers      Basic Authentication - Basic Authentication encodes the username and password in Base64 and sends it in the header. It’s simple but insecure if not used over HTTPS            [ Authorization: Basic &lt; base64-encoded-username:password &gt; ]           Bearer Token Authentication - Bearer Token Authentication involves sending a token that authorizes the client to access resources. This is commonly used in OAuth 2.0.            [ Authorization: Bearer &lt; token &gt; ]           API Key Authentication - API Key Authentication uses a key passed in the request header to authenticate the request.            [ Authorization: ApiKey your-api-key ]           Digest Authentication - Digest Authentication is more secure than Basic Authentication. It involves a server-specified data set that is hashed and sent along with the username.            [ Authorization: Digest username=”user”, realm=”example.com”, nonce=”xyz”, uri=”/”, response=”abc123” ]           HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code) - HMAC involves hashing the request data and secret key together to generate a signature.            [ Authorization: HMAC username=”user”, signature=”generated-signature” ]           Custom Token-Based Authentication - A custom token-based approach can use a custom header field to pass the token.            [ X-Auth-Token: your-custom-token ]           Notes:      HTTP - Always use HTTPS to encrypt the headers and protect sensitive information   Security - Avoid sending sensitive data like passwords in headers without encryption   Token Expiration - For token-based methods, consider token expiration and refresh mechanisms   Security Related HTTP Headers      Content Security Policy (CSP): - CSP helps prevent XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.            [ Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘self’; img-src ‘self’ https://example.com; script-src ‘none’; ]           Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP): - CORP prevents a resource from being loaded by a document from a different origin unless explicitly allowed.            [ Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin ]           Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP): - COOP isolates the browsing context, mitigating the risk of cross-origin attacks.            [ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin ]           Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP): - COEP ensures that the document only loads cross-origin resources that grant permission.            [ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp ]           DNS Prefetch Control: - Controls whether the browser prefetches DNS for links to reduce latency.            [ X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off ]           Expect-CT: - Helps detect and prevent misissued SSL/TLS certificates.            [ DNS-Prefetch-Control: off ]           Feature Policy: Allows control over which features and APIs can be used in the browser.            [ Feature-Policy: geolocation ‘self’; microphone ‘none’ ]           Frameguard: Prevents clickjacking attacks by controlling whether the browser can render your site in a frame.            [ X-Frame-Options: DENY ]           Hide Powered-By: Removes the X-Powered-By header to make it less obvious what technology the app is using.            [ X-Powered-By: ]           HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security): Forces the use of HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.            [ Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains ]           IE No Open: Sets X-Download-Options to prevent Internet Explorer from executing downloads in the site’s context.            [ X-Download-Options: noopen ]           No Sniff: Helps prevent browsers from sniffing MIME types.            [ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff ]           Referrer Policy: Controls the information sent in the Referer header.            [ Referrer-Policy: no-referrer ]           XSS Filter:  Enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter built into most browsers.            [ X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block ]           CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) HTTP Headers   Notes: CORS is a mechanism that allows web servers to specify who can access their resources from different origins (domains).      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Specifies which origin(s) are allowed to access the resource. Can be a specific domain or * (to allow all domains).            [ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com ]       [ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * ]           Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed when accessing the resource.            [ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE ]           Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Lists the headers that are allowed to be used when making the request.            [ Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With ]           Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: Indicates whether credentials (like cookies) are allowed in the request.            [ Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true ]           Access-Control-Max-Age: Specifies how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.            [ Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 ]           Session, Cookies, and Tokens: Differences and Use Cases                  Feature       Session       Cookies       Tokens                       Definition       A server-side mechanism to store user state.

        "excerpt":"What is a Session?   A session is a temporary state maintained on the server that tracks a user’s activity across multiple requests. It typically stores user authentication details, preferences, or other data needed during an interaction.   How It Works      User logs in → Server creates a session (stores it in memory, database, or file).   The server generates a session ID and sends it to the client in a cookie.   The client sends the session ID on every request → Server retrieves session data.   What is a Cookie?   A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the client (browser) and sent to the server with every request. It can store user preferences, authentication details, or tracking information.   How It Works      Server sends a Set-Cookie header → Browser stores the cookie.   Browser sends the cookie with every subsequent request.   Types of Cookies      Session Cookies: Deleted when the browser is closed.   Persistent Cookies: Stored for a long time (set expiration date).   Secure Cookies: Only sent over HTTPS.   HttpOnly Cookies: Not accessible by JavaScript (prevents XSS attacks).   SameSite Cookies: Prevents CSRF attacks by restricting cross-site requests.   What is a Token?   A token is a cryptographic string used to authenticate users without storing state on the server. The most common type is JSON Web Token (JWT).   How It Works      User logs in → Server generates a JWT and sends it to the client.   Client stores the JWT in localStorage, sessionStorage, or a cookie.   The client sends the JWT with every request in the Authorization header.   The server verifies the JWT using a secret key (HMAC) or public/private key pair (RSA).

Tokens (JWT) + Cookies: JWTs can be stored in cookies (HttpOnly for security) or localStorage/sessionStorage.   Tokens vs. Sessions: Sessions require server storage, while tokens (like JWT) allow stateless authentication.   Best Practices   For Sessions      Use secure cookies for session IDs (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict).   Regenerate session IDs on login to prevent session fixation.   Set a timeout for inactive sessions.   For Cookies      Use HttpOnly and Secure flags to prevent JavaScript access.   Use SameSite=Strict or Lax to prevent CSRF attacks.   Encrypt sensitive data (don’t store passwords in cookies).   For Tokens (JWT)      Use short-lived tokens (e.g., 15 min) + refresh tokens.   Store JWTs in HttpOnly cookies instead of localStorage.   Sign JWTs with strong algorithms (HS256 for shared secret, RS256 for public/private key pairs).   ","categories": ["System Design"],
